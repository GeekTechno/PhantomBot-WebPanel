PhantomBot WebPanel
===

This is an alternative to the WebPanel developed by the PhantomBot developers.
If you are looking for theirs head over to [The PhantomBot Website](http://www.phantombot.net).

This software is free to user under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.  
Some of the modules in PhantomBot aren't yet supported in this panel. But I will add these as soon as I can!
